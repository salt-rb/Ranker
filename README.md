# Ranker

To run, simply run the ranker.py file. You may need to install some packages if you don't have them already (specifically numpy, PySimpleGUI, or pickle). This can be done by running ```pip install [package name]```

As the names suggest, do not delete files with the "rankerDoNotDelete" prefix. If you do delete these, previously saved workspaces will be lost.
