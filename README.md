# Ranker

## Overview

Ranker is a tool that allows you to create ranked lists of your favorite movies, songs, books, or pretty much anything else using head-to-head matches to generate ELO scores to assign to each item in your list. The more you run the Ranker, the more accurate your list will be.

## To Run

To run, simply run the ranker.py file. You may need to install some packages if you don't have them already (specifically numpy, PySimpleGUI, or pickle). This can be done by running ```pip install [package name]```

As the names suggest, do not delete files with the "rankerDoNotDelete" prefix. If you do delete these, previously saved workspaces will be lost.
